# Micro-controller-and-interface-autonomous-robot-
The aim of this project is to make an autonomous robot that is
equipped to play soccer in a team of 3. It should also have a
shooting and dribbling mechanism to score and defend. The robot
should be able to receive coordinates from the ELTS using an RF
module for the position of other robots and ball on the map.
